## üöÄ About The Project

Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for protecting crops and ensuring food security. This project aims to provide an accessible tool for farmers and botanists to quickly diagnose diseases by simply uploading a picture of a plant's leaf.

By leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning, this application can classify over 04 different diseases, helping to facilitate timely and effective treatment.
